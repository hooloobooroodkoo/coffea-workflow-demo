# coffea-workflow showcase

A minimal benchmark MET analysis on CMS NanoAOD open data, used to demonstrate the capabilities of the `coffea-workflow` package.

## Analysis

[analysis.py](analysis.py) contains a self-contained coffea processor that fills a MET histogram over two datasets (`SingleMu_0`, `SingleMu_1`), each with 5 NanoAOD files from CMS Open Data. 
It is intentionally primitive - the point is to show how `coffea-workflow` wraps any analysis, not to do physics. One of the files is also intentionally broken
to showcase how coffea-workflow helps to preserve partial results and to run the analysis until the end.
